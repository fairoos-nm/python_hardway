#Module class and objects.

#Modules are like dictionaries

mystuff = {"apple": "I love apples"}

print(mystuff["apple"])

#here we can call a value in dictionaries using thair keys:
#Assume that you have file mystuff.py and it containing a function called apple:

# def apple():
#     print("I love apples")
# my_name = "name"

#You can call it like this function from some where like

#import mystuff.py
#mystuff.apple()
#print(mystuff.my_name)
